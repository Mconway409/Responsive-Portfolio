# Responsive-Portfolio
Contains a site with 3 different pages. 1 about me, 1 contact page, and 1 page with personal images.

## Description
In this asignment I built a site that is all about me! There are three disctinct pages, all linked together through a navigation bar at the top of each page. The first is an about me page that shows a picture of me (and a bit of my dog) and gives a brief description of who I am. The second page has a contact form for people trying to reach me, and the third page shows a couple of different personal pictures. I hope you enjoy!

## Screenshots of Each Page
